Feedbacks from previous submission: 

```
please replace \dontrun{} by \donttest{} or if(interactive()){} 
(for interactive examples) in your Rd-files if this is feasible.
```

-> We replaced them 

```
Please ensure that your functions do not write by default or in your 
examples/vignettes/tests in the user's home filespace.(...). 
Please only write/save files if the user has specified 
a directory.
```

-> One of the goal of {golem} is to write files to disk, in the spirit of {usethis}. But nothing is written without the user knowing it: 

+ when first using a project created by golem, the user has to set a series of options, one being the current "golem working directory". 
+ All writing functions then have a parameter to specify the path, which default to a path returned by `get_golem_wd`. 
+ The `set_golem_wd` allows to change globally this path, and the user is informed of that through a message to the console whenever this path is set. 

```
Please ensure that you do not install packages in your functions without 
the user's knowledge or without the possibility to change the target 
library.
```

-> There is no function in {golem} installing packages: the only "install.packages"to be found is the one which is written inside the Dockerfile generated by `add_dockerfile`, so nothing is installed in the user library.

```
You are using installed.packages(): do not use 
it to find out if a named package is installed (...) 
nor to find out if a package is usable
```

-> We used the install.packages function to check which packages are of priority 'basic'. We switched to an hardcoded vector containing these packages.
